# No-Regret Learning in Riemannian Zero-Sum Games

## Requirements

To install requirements:
scipy, numpy and matplotlib:
```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib
```
Pymanopt:
```
pip install --user pymanopt
```

## Experiment

All the experiment are included in './experiment'.

For the quadratic logdet game, just run the corresponding python file in the './experiment/logdet_con' and './experiment/logdet_reg'

For the Geometry-aware robust PCA, please first run 'generate_m.py' to generate data.
